A few absolute-pathed stuff, so amend them to your own settings.

launchd file is here for your reference.
One way to do this is to put it in /Library/LaunchAgents/
then "launchctl start com.samwong.checkwifi". It will then launch on boot.

Wifi keeps dying, customer service suggested the following:
	Deirdre: Ok we dont guarantee a wireless connection to any customer as there are so many things that can cause interference. What we do advise is that you change the wireless channel on the hub to one of the other 11 channels.
	Deirdre: Yes - basically if there is something causing interference on the one you are set on you need to change to it to see if one of the others gives you a better connection. Unfortunately if you have tried all of the channels and it still wont hold a wireless connection then it simply means there is too much interference in your area which is beyond BT's control so you would need to connect with ethernet 
	
	The last message is too awesome to keep it to myself.
